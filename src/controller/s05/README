EMC of diffraction pattern with smaller pixel size:
Simulation parameters:
Path: s05
Purpose: Test the effect of OR comparing to s01
Orientation distribution: random distribution
Photon energy: 6 keV
Resolution at the detector edge: 9.64 A  (Full period resolution)
Pixel number: 220 x 220
Pixel size: 500 um
Sample to detector distance: 0.25 m
(Fluence calculation) 4.16 x 10^12 photons x 0.38 (optics efficiency) / (250 nm x 150 nm) = 0.42 x 10^22 photons/cm^2
Number of diffraction patterns: 1560
